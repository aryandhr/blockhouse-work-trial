    "The paper \"Portfolio Optimization with Linear and Fixed Transaction Costs\" by Miguel Sousa Lobo, Maryam Fazel and Stephen Boyd considers the problem of portfolio optimization with variable transaction costs as a nonconvex optimization problem that can be broken down into convex optimization subproblems. Their method results in a suboptimal portfolio and an upper bound on the actual optimal portfolio, and they find that in practice the gap between the two is small.\n",

    "$\\phi(x)$ is the transaction cost function, <br>\n",
    "$S$ is the set of feasible portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evidently, it follows that the problem of minimizing the total transaction costs subject to portoflio constraints can be formulated as such:\n",
